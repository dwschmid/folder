# Folder

Folder is a numerical tool for modelling deformation in layered media. It is developed in Matlab and compatible with Matlab versions from 2014b onwards.

Folder is documented in the Journal of Structural Geology article:

### Getting Started
Download the Matlab source code as a zip, unpack on your computer, and run 
```Matlab
folder
```

### Externals
FGT relies on the following external packages. They are included in the source, so no need to install separately.
