- data types are not synchronized with rest of mutils in the MATLAB case. 
  dimType is a 64-bit value here, and we want it rather to be 32 bit.
  In sparse_create Int is used instead of dimType, and dimType is only
  used to translate data to/from MATLAB

- NUMA support missing

- other types of data distributions. Currently only 'copy' distribution is
  supported: every thread works on a local copy of the matrix part. 
  Other interesting distributions are e.g. Shared Memory, where every
  thread accesses required data in the shared matrix data structure.

- use sorted_list in matrix modifications (transpose, permute etc).

- error messages: unify with MUTILS

- use SCOTCH
